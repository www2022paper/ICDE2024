## Note: we are preparing the clean code, we will upload it by 2023/12/09. Thanks.






1. To support the use of Area under Uplift Curve (AUUC), install causalML from https://causalml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.

2. To support the use of Generalized Random Forests (GRF) , install econML from https://github.com/microsoft/EconML.

3. Tensorflow 2.4.1 and keras 2.4.3 are used in this experiment.

4. The directory structure is shown as follows.

5. Download the dataset named CRITEO-UPLIFT v2 from https://ailab.criteo.com/criteo-uplift-prediction-dataset/. You can put this dataset in the data directory, and rename it as "criteo-uplift-v2.1.csv". By this way, you can run the demo in the code directory based on this dataset.

6. Due to data privacy, the real business marketing data used in this experiment is not provided. There may be multiple notebook files in the "code/marketing_data_code" directory, which represent the training demos of different models.
